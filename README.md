## Microgrant Fund

This is a no-strings-attached grant of Â£1,000 to people working on technical projects addressing with the climate crisis.

#### Operating Theory

We believe:

- Change should be made locally
- Anyone should be able to contribute
- A multitude of different approaches are necessary
- Exploration and failure will be part of the process
- Solutions need to be community-led and community-controlled

#### Rough selection criteria

- Community impact: Who else is impacted?
- Personal impact: Does this open up new opportunities?
- Follow-up work; what can be built from this?
- Open-source work?

#### Application process

1. Complete the typeform application
2. Reviewed by a selection of the [project selection committee](./committee.md)
3. Select for short interview
4. Decision

#### Payout strategy

- 30% upon project acceptance;

- final 30% upon completion.

#### Process after project acceptance

1. Invite to community
2. Informal check-in
