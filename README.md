## Mission

Supporting you to find a sustainable fixed point for the planet :)


## Microgrant fund

This is a no-strings-attached grant of Â£1,000 to people working on technical projects addressing the climate crisis.


#### Operating theory

We believe:

- Change should be made locally,
- Anyone should be able to contribute,
- A multitude of different approaches are necessary,
- Exploration and failure will be part of the process,
- Solutions need to be community-led and community-controlled[^community].

#### Rough selection criteria

- The project:
  - Is it climate tech?
  - Does it add something new either for the proposer, or the community, or both?
  - Is it (even plausibly) feasible?
  - Is it open-source? Why/Why not?
- Community impact: Who else is impacted?
- Personal impact: Does this open up new opportunities?
- Follow-up work; what can be built from this?
- Planned deliverables
  - Article
  - Video
  - Library
  - Talk
  - Podcast


#### Application process

1. Complete the typeform application
2. Reviewed by a selection of the [project selection committee](./committee.md)
3. Select for short interview
4. Decision


#### Payout strategy

- 40% upon project acceptance;
- 30% at halfway mark
- final 30% upon completion.


#### Process after project acceptance

1. Invite to community
2. Informal check-in
3. Schedule mid-way check-in
4. Schedule endpoint check-in
5. Capture final project output (at least one blog post? + any other output)
6. Post-project experience report


#### Example project ideas

- An interactive article exploring some climate topic in detail
- A data-cleaning project, putting cleaned data into, say, OSM
- Build a small open-source library for a niche corner of the climate tech ecosystem
- Design a short class covering climate awareness/actions for technologists
- Something related to climate policy
