# Contributing

If you're looking to make changes to any of the PDFs, you'll need to use the
nix-shell and the Makefile:

```
nix-shell
make # See all possible targets
```

### Git LFS

We use [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) to handle documents in this
repository. You'll only need to install it once on your system, and it should
"just work".
