>       of the Charities Act 2011.
>    c. Subject to sub-clause (3) of this clause a charity trustuee or

>    c. The other charity trustees are satisfied that it is in the best
>        interests of the CIO to contract with the supplier rather than with
>        someone who is not a charity trustee or connected person. In reaching
>        that decision the charity trustees must balance the advantage of
>        contracting with a charity trustee or connected person against the
>        disadvantages of doing so.
>    d. The supplier is absent from the part of any meeting at which there is
>        discussion of the proposal to enter into a contract or arrangement with
