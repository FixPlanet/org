   purposes.

7. Clause 6 does not prevent the organisation making any payment which is
   permitted under clauses 41 to 44 (remuneration and expenses).


## Liability of charity trustees

8. The charity trustees of the organisation (in their capacity as members -
   see clause 12) have no liability to pay any sums to help to meet the debts
   (or other liabilities) of the organisation if it is wound up; accordingly,
   if the organisation is unable to meet its debts, the charity trustees will
   not be held responsible.

9. The charity trustees have certain legal duties under the Scottish Charities
   Act; and clause 8 does not exclude (or limit) any personal liabilities they
   might incur if they are in breach of those duties, or in breach of other
   legal obligations or duties that apply to them personally.


## General structure

10. The structure of the organisation consists of the BOARD - who hold regular
    meetings, and generally control the activities of the organisation; for
    example, the board is responsible for monitoring and controlling the
    financial position of the organisation.

11. The board also appoints charity trustees to fill vacancies, and the people
    serving on the board (in their capacity as members of the organisation -
    see clauses 12 and 14) have power to make changes to the constitution
    itself.

12. The people serving on the board are referred to in this constitution as
    CHARITY TRUSTEES - and they are also the MEMBERS of the organisation for
    the purposes of the Scottish Charities Act.

13. Under the provisions of this constitution, no-one can be a member unless
    they are also a charity trustee of the organisation; and if anyone ceases
    for any reason to be a charity trustee of the organisation, they
    automatically cease to be a member.

14. The Scottish Charities Act requires certain decisions to be taken by the
    charity trustees in their capacity as members of the organisation.
