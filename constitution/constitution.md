# GENERAL

## Type of Organisation


1. The organisation will, upon registration, be a Scottish Charitable
   Incorporated Organisation (SCIO).


## Scottish principal office

2. The principal office of the organisation will be in Scotland (and must
   remain in Scotland).


## Name

3. The name of the organisation is "Fix Planet Club SCIO"


## Purposes

4. The organisation's purposes are:

... TODO INSERT and Reviews.


## Powers

5. The organisation has power to do anything which is calculated to further
   its purposes or is conducive or incidental to doing so.

6. No part of the income or property of the organisation may be paid or
   transferred (directly or indirectly) to the charity trustees - either in
   the course of the organisation's existence or on dissolution - except where
   this is done in direct furtherance of the organisation's charitable
   purposes.

7. Clause 6 does not prevent the organisation making any payment which is
   permitted under clauses 41 to 44 (remuneration and expenses).


## Liability of charity trustees

8. The charity trustees of the organisation (in their capacity as members -
   see clause 12) have no liability to pay any sums to help to meet the debts
   (or other liabilities) of the organisation if it is wound up; accordingly,
   if the organisation is unable to meet its debts, the charity trustees will
   not be held responsible.

9. The charity trustees have certain legal duties under the Scottish Charities
   Act; and clause 8 does not exclude (or limit) any personal liabilities they
   might incur if they are in breach of those duties, or in breach of other
   legal obligations or duties that apply to them personally.


## General structure

10. The structure of the organisation consists of the BOARD - who hold regular
    meetings, and generally control the activities of the organisation; for
    example, the board is responsible for monitoring and controlling the
    financial position of the organisation.

11. The board also appoints charity trustees to fill vacancies, and the people
    serving on the board (in their capacity as members of the organisation -
    see clauses 12 and 14) have power to make changes to the constitution
    itself.

12. The people serving on the board are referred to in this constitution as
    CHARITY TRUSTEES - and they are also the MEMBERS of the organisation for
    the purposes of the Scottish Charities Act.

13. Under the provisions of this constitution, no-one can be a member unless
    they are also a charity trustee of the organisation; and if anyone ceases
    for any reason to be a charity trustee of the organisation, they
    automatically cease to be a member.

14. The Scottish Charities Act requires certain decisions to be taken by the
    charity trustees in their capacity as members of the organisation.

    by way of a resolution passed by majority vote at a board meeting.

20. At the conclusion of the first AGM, one third (to the nearest round

    the same date, the question of which of them is to retire shall be decided
    by some random method.

23. A charity trustee who retires from office under clause 20 or 21 at the
    conclusion of an AGM shall be eligible for re-appointment under clause 19
    at the next board meeting.

25. A charity trustee will automatically cease to hold office if:

d. They give the organisation a notice of resignation (either in writing or
by email);

e. They are absent (without good reason, in the opinion of the board) for
more than three consecutive board meetings - but only if the board resolve

that they are considered to have committed a serious breach of the code of
conduct for charity trustees (as referred to in clause 45); or

g. They are removed from office by resolution of the board on the grounds
that they are considered to have been in serious or persistent breach of
their duties under section 66(1) or (2) of the Scottish Charities Act.

26. A resolution under paragraph (f) or (g) of clause 25 shall be valid only
    if:

a. The charity trustee concerned is given reasonable prior notice (in
writing or by email) of the grounds upon which the resolution for their
removal is to be proposed.

meeting at which the resolution is proposed, prior to the resolution being
put to the vote; and

c. At least two thirds (to the nearest round number) of the charity trustees

## Register of charity trustees

27. The board must keep a register of charity trustees, setting out:

a. For each current charity trustee:

  i. Their full name and address,
  ii. The date on which they were appointed as a charity trustee; and
  iii. Any office held by them in the organisation

b. For each former charity trustee - for at least 6 years from the date on
which they ceaused to be a charity trustee:

  i. The name of the charity trustee;
  ii. Any office held by them in the organisation; and
  iii. The date on which they ceased to be a charity trustee.

28. The board must ensure that the register of charity trustees is updated
    within 28 days of any change:

a. Which arises from a resolution of the board; or

b. Which is notified to the organisation.

29. If any person requests a copy of the register of charity trustees, the
    board must ensure that a copy is supplied to them within 28 dates,
    providing the request is reasonable; if the request is made by a person
    who is not a charity trustee of the organisation, the board may provide a
    copy which has the addresses blanked out - if the organisation is
    satisfied that including that information is likely to jeopardise the
    safety or security of any person or premises.

30. The members of the organisation are identical to its charity trustees -
    and therefore the organisation does not require to keep a separate
    register of members.

31. The charity trustees must elect (from among themselves) a chair, a
    treasurer and a secretary.

32. In addition to the office-bearers required under clause 31, the charity
    trustees may elect (from among themselves) future office-bearers if they
    consider that appropriate.

33. All of the office-bearers will cease to hold office at the conclusion of
    each AGM, but may then be re-elected by the board (after the AGM) under
    clause 31 or 32.

34. A person elected to any office will automatically cease to hold that
    office:

a. If they cease to be a charity trustee; or

b. The give to the organisation a notice of resignation from that office
(either in writing or by email).


## Powers of board

35. Except where this constitution states otherwise:

a. The organisation (and its assets and operations) will be managed by the
board; and

b. The board may exercise all the powers of the organisation.

36. A meeting of the board at which a quorum is present may exercise all
    powers exercisable by the board.


## Charity trustees - general duties

37. Each of the charity trustees has a duty, in exercising functions as a
    charity trustee, to act in the interests of the organisation; and, in
    particular, must:

a. Seek, in good faith, to ensure that the organisation acts in a matter which
is in accordance with its purposes;

b. Act with the care and diligence which it is reasonable to expect of a
person who is managing the affairs of another person;

c. In circumstances giving rise to the possibility of a conflict of interest
between the organisation and any other party:

  i. Put the interests of the organisation before that of the other party; or
  ii. Where any other duty prevents them from doing so, disclose the
  conflicting interest to the organisation and refrain from participating in
  any deliberation or decision of the other charity trustees with regard to
  the matter in question;

d. Ensure that the organisation complies with any direction, requirement,
  notice, or duty imposed under or by virtue of the Scottish Charities Act.

38. In addition to the duties outlined in clause 37, all of the charity
    trustees must take such steps as are reasonably practicable for the
    purpose of ensuring:

a. That any breach of any of those duties by a charity trustee is corrected by
the charity trustee concerned and not repeated; and

b. That any charity trustee who has been in serious or persistent breach of
those duties is removed as a charity trustee.


## Conflicts of interest involving charity trustees - general

39. The board must use every effort to ensure that conflicts of interest
    involving charity trustees (including those which relate to individuals or
    bodies connected with charity trustees) are identified at the earliest
    opportunity and appropriately managed; the following provisions of this
    constitution are of particular relevance:

a. Clauses 40 and 43 require charity trustees to declare any personal interest
which they may have in any transaction or other arrangement with the
organisation;

b. Clause 63 prohibits a charity trustee with a personal interest in a
proposed arrangement from voting on the question of whether the organisation
should enter into that arrangement;

c. Clause 42 (reflecting similar provisions contained in the Scottish
Charities Act) sets out restrictions and conditions for any arrangement
under which remuneration would be paid to a charity trustee (or where the
charity trustee might benefit from remuneration paid to a connected
party).

40. In addition to complying with the provisions referred to in clause 39.

a. The board must maintain a register of charity trustees’ interests;

b. The chairperson of each board meeting must invite declarations of interest,
  shortly after the start of the meeting;

c. The minutes of each board meeting must record any conflicts of interest
which have been declared at the meeting and must set out in detail how any
such conflicts of interest have been managed.

41. No charity trustee may serve as an employee (full time or part time) of
    the organisation; and no charity trustee may be given any remuneration by
    the organisation for carrying out their duties as a charity trustee.

42. Where a charity trustee provides services to the organisation or might
    benefit from any remuneration paid to a connected party for such services:

a. The maximum amount of the remuneration must be specified in a written
agreement and must be reasonable;

b. The board must be satisfied that it would be in the interests of the
organisation to enter into the arrangement (taking account of that maximum
amount); and

c. Less than half of the charity trustees must be receiving remuneration from
the organisation (or benefit from remuneration of that nature).

43. Provided they have declared their interest - and have not voted on the
    question of whether or not the organisation should enter into the
    arrangement - a charity trustee will not be debarred from entering into an
    arrangement with the organisation in which they have a personal interest
    where that is not prohibited by clause 41 or 42; and (subject to clause
    42 and to the provisions relating to remuneration for services
    contained in the Scottish Charities Act), they may retain any personal
    benefit which arises from that arrangement.

44. The charity trustees may be paid all travelling and other expenses
    reasonably incurred by them in connection with carrying out their duties;
    this may include expenses relating to their attendance at meetings.

## Code of conduct for charity trustees

45. Each of the charity trustees shall comply with the code of conduct
    (incorporating detailed rules on conflict of interest) prescribed by the
    board from time to time.

46. The code of conduct referred to in clause 45 shall be supplemental to the
    provisions relating to the conduct of charity trustees contained in this
    constitution and the duties imposed on charity trustees under the Scottish
    Charities Act; and all relevant provisions of this constitution shall be
    interpreted and applied in accordance with the provisions of the code of
    conduct in force from time to time.

# Decision-making by the charity trustees

## Notice of board meetings

47. Any charity trustee may call a meeting of the board or may ask the
    secretary to call a meeting of the board.

48. At least 7 days' notice must be given of each board meeting, unless (in
    the opinion of the person calling the meeting) there is a degree of
    urgency which makes that inappropriate.

49. If charity trustees are to be permitted to participate in a board meeting
    by way of audio and/or audio-visual link(s), the charity trustees must, in
    advance of the meeting, be provided with details of how to connect and
    participate via that link or links; and (particularly for the benefit of
    those charity trustees who may have difficulties in using a computer
    or laptop for this purpose) the charity trustees' attention should be
    drawn to the following options:

a. Participating in the meeting via an audio link accessed by phone, using
  dial-in details (if that forms part of the arrangements);

b. (where attendance in person is to be permitted, either on an open basis or
    subject to a restriction on the total number who will be permitted to
    attend) the ability to attend the meeting in person.

## Procedure at board meetings

50. No valid decisions can be taken at a board meeting unless a quorom is
    present; the quorum for board meetings is two (2) charity trustees,
    present in person.

51. An individual participating in a board meeting via an audio or
    audio-visual link will be deemed to be present in person (or, if they are
    not a charity trustee, will be deemed to be in attendance) at the
    meeting.

52. If at any time the number of charity trustees in office falls below the
    number stated as the quorum in clause 50, the remaining charity trustee(s)
    will have power to fill the vacancies or call a members' meeting - but will
    not be able to take any other valid decisions.

53. The chair of the organisation should act as chairperson of each board
    meeting.

54. If the chair of the organisation is not present within 15 minutes after
    the time at which the meeting was due to start (or is not willing to act
    as chairperson),  the charity trustees present at the meeting must
    elect (from among themselves) the person who will act as chairperson of
    that meeting.

55. Every charity trustee has one vote, which must be given personally
    (subject to clause 61).

56. All decisions at board meetings will be made by majority vote.

57. If there is an equal number of votes for and against any resolution, the
    chairperson of the meeting will be entitled to a second (casting) vote.

58. The board may if they consider appropriate (and must, if that is required
    under clause 59) allow charity trustees to participate in board meetings
    by way of an audio and/or audio-visual link or links which allow them to hear
    and contribute to discussions at the meeting, providing:

a. The means by which charity trustees can participate via that link or links
are not subject to technical complexities, significant costs or other factors
which are likely to represent - for all, or a significant proportion, of the
charity trustees - a barrier to participation; and

b. The manner in which the meeting is conducted ensures, so far as reasonably
possible, that those charity trustees who participate via an audio or
audio-visual link are not disadvantaged with regard to their ability to
contribute to discussions at the meeting, as compared with those charity
trustees (if any) who are attending in person (and vice versa).

59. If restrictions arising from public health legislation or guidance are
    likely to mean that attendance in person at a proposed board meeting would
    not be possible or advisable for one or more of the charity trustees, the
    board must make arrangements for charity trustees to participate in that
    board meeting by way of audio and/or audio-visual link(s) which allow them
    to hear and contribute to discussions at the meeting; and on the basis
    that:

a. The requirements set out in paragraphs (a) and (b) of clause 58 will apply;
and

b. the board must use all reasonable endeavours to ensure that all charity
trustees have access to one or more means by which they may hear and
contribute to discussions at the meeting.

60. A board meeting may involve two or more charity trustees participating via
    attendance in person while other charity trustees participate via audio
    and/or audio-visual links; or it may involve participation solely via
    audio and/or audio-visual links.

61. Where a charity trustee is participating in a board meeting via an audio
    or audio-visual link, they may cast their vote on a given resolution
    orally, or by way of some form of visual indication, or by use of a voting
    button or similar, or by way of a message sent electronically.

62. The board may, at its discretion, allow any person to attend (whether in
    person or by way of an audio or audio-visual link) and speak at a board
    meeting notwithstanding that they are not a charity trustee - but on the basis
    that they must not participate in decision-making.

63. A charity trustee must not vote at a board meeting (or at a meeting of a
    sub-committee) on any resolution which relates to a matter in which they
    have a personal interest or duty which conflicts (or may conflict) with the
    interests of the organisation; they must withdraw from the meeting while an
    item of that nature is being dealt with.

64. For the purposes of clause 63:

a. An interest held by an individual who is "connected" with the charity
trustee under section 68(2) of the Scottish Charities Act (husband/wife,
partner, child, parent, brother/sister etc) shall be deemed to be held by
that charity trustee;

b. A charity trustee will (subject to clause 65) be deemed to have a personal
interest in relation to a particular matter if a body in relation to which
they are an employee, director, member of the management committee, officer or
elected representative (or a body in relation to which they are a major
shareholder or have some other significant financial interest) has an
interest in that matter.

65. Where a subsidiary of the organisation has an interest in a particular
    matter which is to be considered by the board, a charity trustee who is
    also a director of that subsidiary will not be debarred from voting on
    that matter (unless they have a different personal interest in that
    matter, unrelated to their position as a director of that subsidiary).

66. This constitution imposes certain requirements regarding the use of audio
    and/or audio-visual links as a means of participation and voting at board
    meetings; providing the arrangements made by the board in relation to a
    given board meeting (and the manner in which the meeting is conducted) are
    consistent with those requirements:

a. A charity trustee cannot insist on participating in the board meeting, or
voting at the board meeting, by any particular means;

b. The board meeting need not be held in any particular place;

c. The board meeting may be held without any particular number of those
participating in the meeting being present in person at the same place (but,
notwithstanding that,  the quorum requirements - taking account of those
participating via audio and/or audio-visual links - must still be met);

d. The board meeting may be held by any means which permits those
participating in the meeting to hear and contribute to discussions at the
meeting;

e. A charity trustee will be able to exercise the right to vote at the board
meeting by such means as is determined by the chairperson of the meeting
(consistent with the arrangements made by the board) and which permits that
charity trustee’s vote to be taken into account in determining whether or not
a resolution is passed.
