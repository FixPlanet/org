# Code of Conduct

Fix Planet Club is committed to providing a harassment-free experience for
everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of users in any form. Anyone who
violates this code of conduct may be removed from these activities and
channels at the discretion of the Fix Planet Club team.

Some Fix Planet Club activities  may have additional rules in place, which
will be made clearly available to users in the event or channel description.

All participants of our community are responsible for knowing and abiding by
these rules.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

- Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual
  orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical
  appearance, body size, age, race, or religion or belief.
- Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices,
  including those related to food, health, marriage, parenting, drugs, and
  employment.
- Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names.
- Sharing/using NSFW/sexual images, language or behaviour in any spaces.
- Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions
    like "*hug*" or "*backrub*") without consent or after a request to stop.
- Threats of violence.
- Incitement of violence towards any individual or group, including
  encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.
- Deliberate intimidation.
- Stalking or following.
- Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for
  harassment purposes.
- Sustained disruption of discussion.
- Unwelcome sexual attention.
- Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming
  inappropriate levels of intimacy with others.
- Continued one-on-one communication after any request(s) to cease.
- Deliberate "outing" of any aspect of a person's identity without their
  consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional
  abuse.
- Publication of non-harassing private communication.
- Patronising language. Avoid referring to adults as 'girls' or 'boys'.

Additionally, and more specifically to our sector, the following behaviours
are unwelcome:
- No feigned surprise. When someone says "I don’t know what X is", it's not
  appropriate to respond with "You don't know what X is?!" or "I can't believe
  you don't know what X is!".
- No well-actuallys. These are the pedantic corrections that don't make a
  difference to the conversation that's happening.
- No rabid fandom or flame wars. Just because Programming Language X has
  feature Y doesn't mean everyone who doesn't use it is making the biggest
  mistake of their lives.

Fix Planet Club prioritises marginalised people's safety over privileged
people's comfort. The Fix Planet Club team reserves the right not to act on
complaints regarding:

- 'Reverse'-isms, including 'reverse racism,' 'reverse sexism,' and 'cisphobia'.
- Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as "leave me alone," "go away,"
  or "I’m not discussing this with you."
- Communicating in a 'tone' you don’t find congenial.
- Criticising racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behaviour or
  assumptions.

## Reporting

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have
any other concerns, please email us at fixplanetclub@protonmail.com. Emails to
this address will be received by Fix Planet Club's trustees. After receiving
the complaint somebody will be in touch to discuss further and take a record
of your account. We will respond as promptly as we can. If other parties need
to become involved in the process as your complaint progresses, we'll work
with you to ensure that you're comfortable and that we have your consent to
share information.

This code of conduct applies to Fix Planet Club activities, but if you are
being harassed by a user within or in the social orbit of Fix Planet Club, we
still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment
by Fix Planet Clubrs seriously.

This includes:

- Harassment outside official channels.
- Harassment that took place at any point in time.

The Fix Planet Club team reserves the right to exclude people from Fix Planet
Club activities based on their past behaviour, including behaviour outside Fix
Planet Club, and behaviour towards people who are not Fix Planet Club
community members.

In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to
reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended
to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims
of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve
received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if
we believe that doing so will increase the safety of Fix Planet Club tenants
or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their
affirmative consent.

## Consequences

Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the Fix Planet Club team may
take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all
Fix Planet Club community events and channels, and identification of the
participant as a harasser to other Fix Planet Club community members or the
general public, and ending the funding of any applicant found to be breaking
these rules.
